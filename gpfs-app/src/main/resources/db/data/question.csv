The Company’s basic financial instruments other than investments in non-convertible and non-puttable preference shares and non-puttable ordinary shares that are publicly traded or whose fair value can be measured reliably, are subsequently measured at amortized cost less impairment.
The amortized cost of a financial instrument at the end of each reporting period is computed as the net of the amount at which the financial instrument is measured at initial recognition, minus any repayments of the principal, plus or minus the cumulative amortization using the effective interest method of any difference between the amount at initial recognition and the maturity amount, minus, in the case of a financial asset, any reduction (directly or through the use of an allowance account) for impairment or uncollectibility.

Effective interest method
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a financial asset or a financial liability (or a group of financial assets or financial liabilities) and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period, to the carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability. The effective interest rate is determined on the basis of the carrying amount of the financial asset or liability at initial recognition.  
Under the effective interest method, the amortized cost of a financial asset (liability) is the present value of future cash receipts (payments) discounted at the effective interest rate; and the interest expense (income) in a period equals the carrying amount of the financial liability (asset) at the beginning of a period multiplied by the effective interest rate for the period.",

If there is objective evidence of impairment, the entity shall recognise an impairment loss in profit or loss immediately. For guidance in assessing if the assets are impaired read sections 11.22-24 of the IFRS for SMEs ","Impairment of Financial Assets Measured at Cost or Amortized Cost
At the end of each reporting period, an entity shall assess whether there is objective evidence of impairment of any financial assets that are measured at cost or amortized cost. If there is objective evidence of impairment, the entity shall recognize an impairment loss in profit or loss immediately.
Objective evidence that a financial asset or group of assets is impaired includes:
• significant financial difficulty of the issuer or obligor.
• a breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in interest or principal payments.
• the creditor, for economic or legal reasons relating to the debtor’s financial difficulty, granting to the debtor a concession that the creditor would not otherwise consider.
• it has become probable that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization.
• observable data indicating that there has been a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows from a group of financial assets since the initial recognition of those assets, even though the decrease cannot yet be identified with the individual financial assets in the group, such as adverse national or local economic conditions or adverse changes in industry conditions.
For an instrument measured at amortized cost, the impairment loss is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated cash flows discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. If such a financial instrument has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract.
For an instrument measured at cost less impairment, the impairment loss is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the best estimate of the amount that the entity would receive for the asset if it were to be sold at the reporting date. 
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of an impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognized, the entity shall reverse the previously recognized impairment loss either directly or adjusting the allowance account. The reversal shall not result in a carrying amount of the financial asset (net of allowance account) that exceeds what the carrying amount would have been had the impairment not previously recognized. The entity shall recognize the amount of reversal in profit or loss immediately.",
