The Company’s basic financial instruments other than investments in non-convertible and non-puttable preference shares and non-puttable ordinary shares that are publicly traded or whose fair value can be measured reliably, are subsequently measured at amortized cost less impairment.
The amortized cost of a financial instrument at the end of each reporting period is computed as the net of the amount at which the financial instrument is measured at initial recognition, minus any repayments of the principal, plus or minus the cumulative amortization using the effective interest method of any difference between the amount at initial recognition and the maturity amount, minus, in the case of a financial asset, any reduction (directly or through the use of an allowance account) for impairment or uncollectibility.

Effective interest method
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a financial asset or a financial liability (or a group of financial assets or financial liabilities) and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period, to the carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability. The effective interest rate is determined on the basis of the carrying amount of the financial asset or liability at initial recognition.  
Under the effective interest method, the amortized cost of a financial asset (liability) is the present value of future cash receipts (payments) discounted at the effective interest rate; and the interest expense (income) in a period equals the carrying amount of the financial liability (asset) at the beginning of a period multiplied by the effective interest rate for the period.",

For guidance in assessing if the assets are impaired read sections 11.22-24 of the IFRS for SMEs ","Impairment of Financial Assets Measured at Cost or Amortized Cost
At the end of each reporting period, an entity shall assess whether there is objective evidence of impairment of any financial assets that are measured at cost or amortized cost. If there is objective evidence of impairment, the entity shall recognize an impairment loss in profit or loss immediately.
Objective evidence that a financial asset or group of assets is impaired includes:
• significant financial difficulty of the issuer or obligor.
• a breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in interest or principal payments.
• the creditor, for economic or legal reasons relating to the debtor’s financial difficulty, granting to the debtor a concession that the creditor would not otherwise consider.
• it has become probable that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization.
• observable data indicating that there has been a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows from a group of financial assets since the initial recognition of those assets, even though the decrease cannot yet be identified with the individual financial assets in the group, such as adverse national or local economic conditions or adverse changes in industry conditions.
For an instrument measured at amortized cost, the impairment loss is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated cash flows discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. If such a financial instrument has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract.
For an instrument measured at cost less impairment, the impairment loss is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the best estimate of the amount that the entity would receive for the asset if it were to be sold at the reporting date. 
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of an impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognized, the entity shall reverse the previously recognized impairment loss either directly or adjusting the allowance account. The reversal shall not result in a carrying amount of the financial asset (net of allowance account) that exceeds what the carrying amount would have been had the impairment not previously recognized.

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business combination over the fair value of the group’s share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in ‘intangible assets’. Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill amortization is calculated by applying the straight-line method to its estimated useful life. If a reliable estimate cannot be made, the useful life of goodwill is presumed to be 10 years. At each reporting date, the group assesses whether there is any indication that goodwill may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the entity estimates the recoverable amount of the asset. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units (CGUs) (or groups of CGUs) for the purpose of impairment testing.

32,3200,N,,3,Does the company impair tangible and intangible assets other than inventories?,YES_NO,,0,,,"Impairment of Tangible and Intangible Assets Other Than Inventories
Assets that are subject to depreciation or amortization are assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication that the assets are impaired. Where there is any indication that an asset may be impaired, the carrying value of the asset (or cash-generating unit to which the asset has been allocated) is tested for impairment. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognized as an expense.
Tangible and intangible assets that suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.  When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset or cash-generating unit in prior years.
