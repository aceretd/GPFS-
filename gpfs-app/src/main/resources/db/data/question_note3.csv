 Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business combination over the fair value of the group’s share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in ‘intangible assets’. Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill amortization is calculated by applying the straight-line method to its estimated useful life. If a reliable estimate cannot be made, the useful life of goodwill is presumed to be 10 years. At each reporting date, the group assesses whether there is any indication that goodwill may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the entity estimates the recoverable amount of the asset. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
 Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units (CGUs) (or groups of CGUs) for the purpose of impairment testing.

 Derecognition of intangible asset
 An intangible asset is derecognized on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from use or disposal.

 The {{entityType()}}’s basic financial instruments other than investments in non-convertible and non-puttable preference shares and non-puttable ordinary shares that are publicly traded or whose fair value can be measured reliably, are subsequently measured at amortized cost less impairment.
 The amortized cost of a financial instrument at the end of each reporting period is computed as the net of the amount at which the financial instrument is measured at initial recognition, minus any repayments of the principal, plus or minus the cumulative amortization using the effective interest method of any difference between the amount at initial recognition and the maturity amount, minus, in the case of a financial asset, any reduction (directly or through the use of an allowance account) for impairment or uncollectibility.

 Effective interest method
 The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a financial asset or a financial liability (or a group of financial assets or financial liabilities) and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period, to the carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability. The effective interest rate is determined on the basis of the carrying amount of the financial asset or liability at initial recognition. 
 Under the effective interest method, the amortized cost of a financial asset (liability) is the present value of future cash receipts (payments) discounted at the effective interest rate; and the interest expense (income) in a period equals the carrying amount of the financial liability (asset) at the beginning of a period multiplied by the effective interest rate for the period.",

 The {{entityType()}}’s investments in non-convertible and non-puttable preference shares and non-puttable ordinary shares that are publicly traded or whose fair value can be measured reliably are subsequently measured at fair value.

The net gain or loss recognized in profit or loss incorporates any dividend or interest earned on the financial asset and is included in the {{entityType()}}’s statement of income.
 
 If a reliable measure of fair value is no longer available for an asset measured at fair value, its carrying amount at the last date the asset was reliably measurable becomes its new cost. The entity shall measure the asset at this cost amount less impairment until a reliable measure of fair value becomes available.
